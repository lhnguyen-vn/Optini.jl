This repository is a numerical optimization package implemented for pedagogical purposes. Main references include Nocedal & Wright's [*Numerical Optimization*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387303031) and Kochenderfer & Wheeler's [*Algorithms for Optimization*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization).

## Installation

Optini is essentially a scratchpad for me to study optimization algorithms and try out package development in Julia. For state-of-the-art Julia libraries in this space, check out [Optim.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl) and [BlackBoxOptim.jl](https://github.com/robertfeldt/BlackBoxOptim.jl). However, if you  want to experiment with Optini, it is simple to install the package from your Julia REPL by typing
```
]add https://github.com/lhnguyen-vn/Optini.jl
```

## Pluto Notebooks

I am publishing some of my notes on numerical optimization here. These Pluto notebooks are intended to be a fairly comprehensive read and an interactive optimization playground using Optini. More will be added as I go along, and hopefully some will find them useful for their future study.
